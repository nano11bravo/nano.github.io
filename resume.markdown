## Introduction
My name is Samuel Walton and I am a 36 year old tech enthuiast. My past experience in the field has been plentiful. I've worked on various projects where I've had to use critical thinking to complete tasks as well as be flexible enough to wear different hats. The most team-oriented job I've ever worked was for the United States Armed Forces where I served as an Infantryman
in the active duty Army.
